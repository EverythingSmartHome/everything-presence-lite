<p>For most people, Home Assistant will automatically discover and add the EPL immediately, thanks to ESPHomeâ€™s mDNS discovery.</p>

<p>To add it to Home Assistant, simply head to Settings &gt; Devices and Services and you should see the Everything Presence Lite has been automatically discovered and is displayed - simply hit the configure button to add it to Home Assistant and thatâ€™s it!</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-home-assistant-manual-method">Connecting to Home Assistant (Manual method)</h2>

<p>If for some reason the Everything Presence Lite is not automatically discovered, or your network is not setup for mDNS you can add the Lite manually to Home Assistant.</p>

<p>You will need to first figure out what the IP address of your Lite is by checking your routers web page:</p>

<p>You can also use a program like <a href="https://www.fing.com">fing</a> to discover network devices.</p>

<p>Once you have the IP address, head over to Home Assistant and go to Settings &gt; Devices and Services and click the add Integration button in the bottom right.</p>
