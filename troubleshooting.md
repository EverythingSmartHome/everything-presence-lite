## Everything Presence Lite

**Will the EPL detect moving animals or objects?** Yes the EPL will detect any moving thing; a pet, fan or even even moving objects such as blinds.

**Help, my sensor is giving false detections!** The vast majority of the time, the sensor is detecting movement accurately, but users aren't aware of how tiny a movement it is able to detect. Make sure to check out the [tuning guide](https://everythingsmarthome.github.io/everything-presence-lite/tuning.html) for tweaking the settings to get the best results!

**Can the sensor detect the direction of motion or zones?** 
No, it will only show a detected or not detected status. 

**I prefer to 3D print my own case** No worries you can find the files you need here [https://www.printables.com/model/624830-everything-presence-lite-official-case](https://www.printables.com/model/624830-everything-presence-lite-official-case "https://www.printables.com/model/624830-everything-presence-lite-official-case")
