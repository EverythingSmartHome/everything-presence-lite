After adding the Lite to Home Assistant, you may wonder which sensors you can use and what they do. To view all of the sensors and entities, click on the device from the ESPHome menu: . This will show you a dashboard of all of the sensors and controls inside of Home Assistant that you can use in your Automations: . Illuminance . Illuminance is measured from the on-board light sensor in lux. There are slots at the top of the Lite case that allow for light to pass-through and be measured, so make sure not to obstruct these for the best readings. Illuminance supports a configurable offset using the UI which allows you to offset the reported value on the fly to calibrate each of these sensors for your environment. You can do that with these highlighted controls under the configuration section: . mmWave . You will find a sensor called mmWave - this is the output from the mmWave sensor directly and indicates if movement is detected. The mmWave sensor has a configurable offset for the “Blind time” which we will cover below. The default blind time is 15 seconds, which is basically how long the sensor takes to go to an “Off” or “clear” state after motion has stopped being detected: . Offsets for mmWave . The mmWave sensor has an adjustable timeout period inside of Home Assistant using the mmWave Off Latency control. The value is measured in seconds and the default is for 15 seconds. I generally wouldn’t recommend setting this below 10s to help with false clearing. Distance . The mmWave sensor has a configurable distance control inside of Home Assistant. Distance allows you to adjust the max range of the sensor, up to a maximum of 6m. Please note that 6m is the max range, but doesn’t nessecarily mean the sensor is capable of detecting the tiniest of movements at 6m - placement is still important for the best results - see the tuning guide for more information: . If you would like to enable zones 2, 3 and 4, simply click on the entities not shown message: . To reveal entities that are disabled by default: . Click the entity you want to enable, then click the settings icon in the right hand corner of the popup. Then enable the entity: . Wait 30 seconds, refresh the page and the entity is now enabled. Repeat this for each entity you want to enable (start and end zone for example). To setup distance zones, set a start and an end distance for each zone you want to monitor. If you do not want to use one of the zones, leave both the start and the end point set to zero. This is important! . This is very much in beta, so some rules to keep in mind: . | Zones cannot overlap each other | The distance of a zone must be a greater distance than the previous zone. I.e, Zone 2 must not have a lower start and end distance than Zone 1. | If you don’t want to use one or multiple zones, leave the start and end distance set to 0 and it will not be included. | If you want to replicate the previous functionality, i.e you want the sensor to measure everything from 0cm to 510cm, set zone 1 start to 0cm and the end to 510cm. Then set zone 2, zone 3 and zone 4 start and end point to 0. | . You MUST then hit the “set distance” button in the UI for these zones to take effect. Previously, the updated value for distance would be set to the sensor immediately as soon as you changed the slider. This is no longer the case and the set distance button must be used before new values will be sent to the sensor. This is because updating the sliders immediately could cause the sensor to get confused if the user hasn’t quite finished setting up the zones yet. If you make a mistake configuring the zones, the sensor won’t accept the value and nothing will change, but the UI sliders will indicate it has, making it difficult to know. This is a beta/advanced feature so I do want to improve the feedback from the sensor for this to make it more obvious if something didn’t work, but there is a text sensor that will update to show you if the zones were sent correctly or not: . The numbers in the error message are “segments” of the distance set above. The first number is zone 1 start, second number is zone 1 end, third number is zone 2 start, fourth is zone 2 end and so on. These numbers can be multiplied by 15 to get the value in cm, corresponding to what you set in the sliders. Confusing/complicated I know, working on it. Turning off LEDs . The Lite has an LED on the PCB that can be controlled: . ",

Ideally you’ll want the sensor wall mounted or on a sturdy object like a shelf or cabinet - because the mmWave is extremely good at picking up really fine movement, the object it’s mounted needs to be solid, otherwise this could introduce false detections (because there is genuine movement). Don’t place the EPL on top of something that moves with vibrations such as an air-conditioning unit, as these small vibrations will be treated as detections. You also don’t want to place it infront of or near things that move frequently too, as again, these will be picked up as detections. I’ve seen a number of users confused thinking that the sensor is being triggered “falsely”. The vast majority of these are actually real detections - users just weren’t aware that something was moving, or how tiny a movement mmWave sensors can detect! I don’t blame you either, since the only real benchmark you have to go on is a regular PIR, which by comparison, take quite a lot of movement to trigger. Common things that users don’t realise can be triggers are: . | AC units | Plants moving in the wind | Curtains moving in the wind | Water droplets in a bathroom | Ceiling fans | Fans inside of a laptop/TV | . There are ways to try and combat these movements, which we will discuss below - but if you can, try and avoid placement really close to things that move. The mmWave sensor can also “see through” objects, which includes really thin walls - this means that movement could be detected through a wall (but generally this is only really thin walls.) . ",

Distance is really important to set correctly and should be set according to the distance of the room you have the EPL in. If you have the distance set too short, you might miss events that are outside of the range. If it’s set too long for the room, it might catch things that are outside of the room, or it can cause the signal to “bounce”. Don’t set the distance too long for the room it is place in - this can cause undesirable results. You don’t need to be very accurate with the distance, just a rough ball park within roughly 0.5m. ",

    "title": "Sensitivity and Latency",
    "content": "Finally you can adjust the sensitivity and On Latency - both of these paremeters will take the most tuning to suit your environment and do require some on the fly tweaking. Sensitivity is how much motion is required to trigger the sensor. On Latency sets for how long the object must be moving for, before it is considered as moving and thus triggering the sensor. Adding a very small on latency to the sensor will make the mmWave sensor slightly slower to respond, but can drastically reduce detections from unwanted objects, such as a plant moving. Making the mmWave slower to respond should have zero impact, since I would recommend using the EPL’s PIR for things that you want to trigger on. I would recommend starting with 0s of on latency first, which will give you the fastest response time as a nice to have. Then start at a medium sensitivity at a 4-5. Observe the results over a good period of time and check to see if firstly that it is detecting presence accurately when you are in the room, and secondly that is changing to clear (no detection) when you aren’t in the room. If the sensor occasionally changes to not detected for a few seconds when you are in the room, you probably need more sensitivity. However, increasing sensitivity can sometimes cause detections from unwanted objects when you are not in the room, so to combat this, use the on latency and add 0.5s. 0.5s of on latency is generally enough to clear up all detections from undesireable objects, but you can increase more if needed. Start low and increment one step at a time. The process I use is: . | Start at 0s with 4 sensitivity | Observe results | Increase one sensitivity level to get accurate detections when I am in the room | Observe results and repeat until desireable results achieved | Once sensitvity is correct, observe any detections when room is un-occupied | If detections are being triggered when room is un-occupied, add 0.5s to on latency | Observe results, if needed add another 0.5s to on latency | Optional - Adding on latency may allow you to increase sensitivity if needed. | . Ultimately, the best settings for you will come down to your specific room and will depend on your environment. ",
